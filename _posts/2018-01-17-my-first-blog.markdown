This is my second blog post. I am testing `jekyll` tool to create my own blogging web site. This tool is to create a static web site and github support this tool out of the box. So I am very excited to learn this new tool.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets and this looks promising to techical related
blogs.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I will be creating a new web site called [battajegroup.com](www.criclivescorer.com) to test the jekyll and the
github integration. Please stay tuned.
