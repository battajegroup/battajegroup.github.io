When you create a new jekyll project it also creates a README.md file
which has all the information about jekyll. Things like commands
steps,options,settings and so on.

For this project my actual code is located in gitlab.
But exposed as website using github pages.
So you need to build the project in your local and then move
the final site content to the github.
This way no one can see my actual code as gitlab is secured.

Here is the steps.

Move to gitlab/Sample-Project/my-blog folder in the terminal window
run bundle exec jekyll serve

Then move the content of _site folder to the github - battajegroup.github.io Project
github pages should get reflected.
